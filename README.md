Welcome to Alleviation, an e-commerce–style project that has been in the making for quite some time. This project was designed to explore and apply core object-oriented programming concepts while simulating the functionality of a real-world online platform. Alleviation aims to provide users with a structured and intuitive experience, allowing them to browse products, interact with different interfaces, and perform common e-commerce actions within a controlled application environment.

Throughout its development, the project has evolved through multiple iterations, refinements, and collaborative efforts, reflecting both technical growth and improved design decisions. Alleviation serves not only as a functional application, but also as a learning experience—demonstrating problem-solving, code organization, and teamwork in building a scalable software project.
